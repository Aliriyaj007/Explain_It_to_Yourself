# 🧠 Explain It to Yourself

> *If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it.*

A **calm, offline-first learning tool** that helps you verify real understanding by forcing you to explain concepts in your own words.

No accounts. No AI. No distractions. Just thinking.

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Most learners confuse **recognition** with **understanding**.

* Reading notes feels productive
* Watching lectures feels reassuring
* Highlighting text feels like progress

But when asked to explain the idea clearly, everything collapses.

This app exists to solve one problem:

> **False understanding.**

"Explain It to Yourself" applies the *Feynman Technique* in its purest form — without automation, scoring, or pressure.

---

## 🧩 What This Tool Does

It helps you:

* Pick any concept you’re learning
* Explain it in plain language
* Detect gaps in understanding
* Refine your explanation until it’s clear

Nothing more. Nothing less.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (60‑Second Flow)

1. Enter a **concept name** (e.g., Binary Search, Photosynthesis)
2. Write an explanation **as if teaching a beginner**
3. Use the self‑check prompts to question clarity
4. Rewrite until it makes sense
5. (Optional) Save locally for later review

No scoring. No judgment. Just clarity.

## 🧠 The Psychology Behind It

This tool is built on three timeless learning principles:

* **Active Recall** – forcing ideas out of your head
* **Elaboration** – explaining ideas in your own words
* **Feynman Technique** – clarity reveals understanding

If something feels hard to explain, that discomfort is the signal.
